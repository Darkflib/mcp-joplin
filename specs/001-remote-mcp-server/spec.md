# Feature Specification: Joplin MCP Server

**Feature Branch**: `001-remote-mcp-server`  
**Created**: 2025-09-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Remote MCP server to query Joplin personal knowledge manager via API"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an AI assistant or application developer, I want to integrate with a user's Joplin knowledge base through a standardized MCP (Model Context Protocol) interface so that I can search, retrieve, and reference personal notes and information to provide more contextually relevant responses.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a running Joplin instance with existing notes, **When** I connect to the MCP server, **Then** I can authenticate and establish a connection
2. **Given** an authenticated MCP connection, **When** I search for notes containing specific keywords, **Then** I receive a list of matching notes with titles and summaries
3. **Given** a valid note ID, **When** I request the full content of a note, **Then** I receive the complete note text and metadata
4. **Given** multiple notebooks in Joplin, **When** I query for available notebooks, **Then** I receive a list of all accessible notebooks with their names and IDs

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Joplin is not running or unreachable?
- How does the system handle authentication failures or expired tokens?
- What occurs when searching with no matching results?
- How are large notes or binary attachments handled?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST expose MCP-compliant tools for querying Joplin notes
- **FR-002**: System MUST authenticate with Joplin via API token or web clipper service
- **FR-003**: System MUST support searching notes by title, content, and tags
- **FR-004**: System MUST retrieve complete note content including markdown formatting
- **FR-005**: System MUST list available notebooks and their hierarchical structure
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle connection failures gracefully with appropriate error messages
- **FR-007**: System MUST support both local and remote Joplin instances
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide note metadata including creation/modification dates
- **FR-009**: System MUST implement rate limiting to respect Joplin API constraints
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate API responses and handle malformed data
- **FR-011**: System MUST support pagination for large result sets
- **FR-012**: System MUST expose connection configuration through [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: environment variables, config file, or CLI arguments?]

### Key Entities
- **Note**: Individual Joplin note with title, content, tags, notebook association, timestamps
- **Notebook**: Container for organizing notes, with name, ID, and parent relationships
- **Search Result**: Filtered note list with matching scores, titles, and content snippets
- **Connection**: Authentication state and configuration for Joplin API access
- **MCP Tool**: Standardized interface exposing Joplin operations to MCP clients
